🛡️ Long-Term Disability Claim Incident Prediction App

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of a long-term disability (LTD) claim incident using employee demographics, employment attributes, and insurance plan parameters.

The solution combines XGBoost modeling, SHAP-based interpretability, and a Streamlit web interface to deliver predictions along with transparent explanations. The goal is to help insurers, analysts, and benefits teams better understand potential risk drivers behind individual claim incidents.
